# HackTheBox Academy
[HackTheBox Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) is the counterpart to HackTheBox labs, which we've been using over the past few weeks as hacking grounds. 
All of the labs, espcially the starting points, are based on the modules from HackTheBox academy. Because of that, we recommend signing up at [HackTheBox Academy - Register](https://academy.hackthebox.com/register).
Modules (groups of lessons) on Academy cost *cubes*, but every time you complete a module you'll be rewarded with cubes. Tier-0 modules refund the their cost in cubes
on completion, so you can complete all the tier 0 modules for free. You start out with 30 cubes - enough to buy 3 tier-0 modules at once. We recommend starting with
the following (in order):

| Module | Tier/Cost | Reason |
| ------ | ---- | ------ |
| [Setting Up](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/setting-up) | Tier 0, 10 cubes | Sets up the virtual machine environment and toolset |
| [Getting Started](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/getting-started) | Tier 0, 10 cubes | Learning basic tools, walkthrough of how to exploit a machine |
| [Linux Fundamentals](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/linux-fundamentals) | Tier 0, 10 cubes | Fundamentals of the Linux operating system |
